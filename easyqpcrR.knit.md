## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```r
library(EasyqpcR)
```

```
## Warning: Failed to load RGtk2 dynamic library, attempting to install it.
```

```
## Please install GTK+ from http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win64/gtk+/2.22/gtk+-bundle_2.22.1-20101229_win64.zip
```

```
## If the package still does not load, please ensure that GTK+ is installed and that it is on your PATH environment variable
```

```
## IN ANY CASE, RESTART R BEFORE TRYING TO LOAD THE PACKAGE AGAIN
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="easyqpcrR_files/figure-html/pressure-1.png" width="672" />

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
